# Methodology

These pages are designed for GoSource project team members to understand the way we work.  This is important because;

* Most projects are delivered using an internationally distributed "virtual" team including people that have not worked together before.
* Most projects are delivered using a very highly automated devops pipeline that needs developers to write their code in accordance with some very specific conventions.

The table below lists all the methodology notes and the team roles to which they apply.
