# Coding Standards

All GoSource developers will observe the following coding standards

## General


## HTML

Please use coding standards defined for the framework you use. For example, for Bootstrap it means 2 spaces indentation and so on.

## Python

Following [pep8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) is strongly recommended. There are plugins for most popular code editors, so you don't have to think about it - the utils like flake8 will show you all problems and explanations.

If you use Django please read [django-specific style guide](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/writing-code/coding-style/)

## Java


## Javascript
