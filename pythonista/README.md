# Welcome, pythonista!

I assume you are reading this because you are a python programmer who has joined (or is thinking about joining) a GoSource product team.

Good for you! We love python and we love python programmers.

The only thing here at the moment is our [python coding standards](coding_standards.md), but this directory can be considered a kitchen sink into which any python/GoSource resources can be dumped.
